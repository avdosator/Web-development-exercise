            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"><b>chicken</b></a> (Gallus domesticus) is a
                domesticated
                species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally
                from
                India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
                Ceylon
                junglefowl, and green junglefowl).<sup>[1]</sup> Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a
                younger male may be
                called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and
                a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
                (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting,
                which is still practiced in some places.
                Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

            <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
                East Asia,<sup>[3]</sup> but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
                originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern
                Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
                every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
                Thutmose III.<sup>[4][5][6]</sup> They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century
                BC.<sup>[7][8]</sup></p>
